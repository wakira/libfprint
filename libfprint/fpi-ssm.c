/**
 * SECTION:fpi-ssm
 * @title: Sequential state machine
 * @short_description: State machine helpers
 *
 * Asynchronous driver design encourages some kind of state machine behind it.
 * In most cases, the state machine is entirely linear - you only go to the
 * next state, you never jump or go backwards. The #fpi_ssm functions help you
 * implement such a machine.
 *
 * e.g. `S1` ↦ `S2` ↦ `S3` ↦ `S4`
 *
 * `S1` is the start state
 * There is also an implicit error state and an implicit accepting state
 * (both with implicit edges from every state).
 *
 * You can also jump to any arbitrary state (while marking completion of the
 * current state) while the machine is running. In other words there are
 * implicit edges linking one state to every other state.
 *
 * To create an #fpi_ssm, you pass a state handler function and the total number of
 * states (4 in the above example) to fpi_ssm_new(). Note that the state numbers
 * start at zero, making them match the first value in a C enumeration.
 *
 * To start a ssm, you pass in a completion callback function to fpi_ssm_start()
 * which gets called when the ssm completes (both on error and on failure).
 *
 * To iterate to the next state, call fpi_ssm_next_state(). It is legal to
 * attempt to iterate beyond the final state - this is equivalent to marking
 * the ssm as successfully completed.
 *
 * To mark successful completion of a SSM, either iterate beyond the final
 * state or call fpi_ssm_mark_completed() from any state.
 *
 * To mark failed completion of a SSM, call fpi_ssm_mark_failed() from any
 * state. You must pass a non-zero error code.
 *
 * Your state handling function looks at the return value of
 * fpi_ssm_get_cur_state() in order to determine the current state and hence
 * which operations to perform (a switch statement is appropriate).
 *
 * Typically, the state handling function fires off an asynchronous
 * communication with the device (such as a libsub transfer), and the
 * callback function iterates the machine to the next state
 * upon success (or fails).
 *
 * Your completion callback should examine the return value of
 * fpi_ssm_get_error() in order to determine whether the #fpi_ssm completed or
 * failed. An error code of zero indicates successful completion.
