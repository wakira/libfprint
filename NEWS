This file lists notable changes in each release. For the full history of all
changes, see ChangeLog.

2018-12-14: v0.99.0 release
* Library:
  - All the internal API for device driver writers is now covered by the
    documentation and has been enhanced to make it easier to write drivers
  - Update internal NBIS fingerprint data processing library to one that's
    nearly 10 years newer
  - Re-add accessor for minutia coordinates which was used in the very
    old fprint_demo program, but also by our new GTK+ test program (see below)
  - Fix a crash when too many minutiae were detected in a capture

* Drivers:
  - Support more devices in the Elan driver, stability improvements

* Tools:
  - Add a test GTK+ application that will eventually be used for testing
    drivers without modifying the OS installed version. Note that this
    application currently requires manually changing permissions of USB
    devices, this will be fixed when the infrastructure exists to access
    those devices without additional permissions, as a normal user.

2018-07-15: v0.8.2 release
* Drivers:
  - Add USB ID for TNP Nano USB Fingerprint Reader
  - Fix UPEKTS enrollment never finishing on some devices

* Library:
  - Fix fp_get_pollfds() retval type, a small ABI change
  - Downgrade fatal errors to run-time warnings, as a number of drivers
    used to throw silent errors and we made them fatal. Those will now
    be visible warnings, hopefully helping with fixing them.

2018-06-12: v0.8.1 release
- Brown paperbag release to install the udev rules file in the correct
  directory if the udev pkg-config file doesn't have a trailing slash

2018-06-12: v0.8.0 release
- Port to meson as the build system
- Port documentation to gtk-doc

* Drivers:
  - Add Elan driver
  - Increase threshold to detect encryption on URU4000 devices
  - Remove already replaced UPEKE2 driver
  - Fix possible crash caused by vfs5011 when no lines were captured

* Library:
  - Fix a number of memory and file descriptor leaks and warnings
  - Make NSS (and URU4000) driver optional
  - Fix assembling of frames for non-reverse and non reverse stripes
  - Split internal private header to clarify drivers API
  - Simplify logging system, now all the builds can be used to output
    debug information
  - Mark fp_dscv_print functions as deprecated

* Udev rules:
  - Add some unsupported devices to the whitelist

* Library:
  - NBIS: Remove false minutia at the edge of partial image
  - Introduce routines to assemble image from lines (used in VFS5011 and upeksonly)
  - Fix a bug that can cause driver state machine to enter into endless loop. 

* Udev rules:
  - Add driver name to the USB properties

* Plenty of build fixes

  - Add EgisTec ES603 driver
  - Add VFS5011 driver
  - Always perform 5 scans for image enrollment
  - Better verification with AES1660 driver
