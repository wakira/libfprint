  <title>Getting Started</title>

  <para>
  libfprint includes several simple functional examples under the <computeroutput>examples/</computeroutput>
  directory in the libfprint source distribution. Those are good starting
  points.
  </para>

  <para>
  Usually the first thing you want to do is determine which fingerprint
  devices are present. This is done through <ulink url="libfprint-Device-discovery.html">device discovery</ulink>.
  </para>

  <para>
  Once you have found a device you would like to operate, you should open it.
  Refer to <ulink url="libfprint-Devices-operations.html">device operations</ulink>. This section also details enrollment,
  image capture, and verification.
  </para>

  <para>
  That should be enough to get you started, but do remember there are
  documentation pages on other aspects of libfprint's API (see the modules
  page).
